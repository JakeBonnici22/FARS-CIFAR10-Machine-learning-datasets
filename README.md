# FARS-CIFAR10-Machine-learning-datasets

A total of two projects are presented in this report. The first consists of the FARS dataset,
which describes a set of US road traffic accidents, with 20 features and over 100 K rows of
examples. The scope of this project was to predict was to use various different machine learning
techniques to train, validate and predict whether an accident is prone to occur based on various
states of the features.
The second project consists of a CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of data describing a total of
4 quadrant tiles images in a single image, for multiple different tiles of images. This project
focused on predicting the label on each image. A label is defined as the number of unique
CFAR10 image classes within the quadrants of the the image subtract one.
